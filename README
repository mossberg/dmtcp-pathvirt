# Path Virtualization

To run a basic test, run the following:

make
cd slot5
make
make check

Hit Ctrl-C after the first DMTCP checkpoint.

This builds the shared library, then builds the example user application, and
finally runs the test.

The shared library wraps the open syscall, checking if the path begins with
the "oldprefix" global if so, replacing it with the "newprefix" global
and forwarding that to the real/next open syscall.

The user application (pv-test.v) appends to a text file in the processes's
default directory every second, using a global path saved into a local
variable.

`make check` runs the user application in DMTCP, loading the shared library.
After terminating the process, notice that slot5/pv-test.txt contains nothing
while misc/slot7/pv-test.txt contains the output. This shows that the
pathvirt module was able to redirect the applications path usage elsewhere on
the filesystem.

Something strange that I don't understand occurs on DMTCP restart however.
The process seems to be put in the background and requires `kill -9` to
terminate.
